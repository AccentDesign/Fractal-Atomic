# Fratomic

An awesome starter point for your Fractal UI component library based on Atomic Design principles.

[Fractal](https://fractal.build/) is a fantastic tool for building, maintaining and cataloging the various components used to construct a design system, website or software project.

This starting point has been developed to adhere to the principles of [Atomic Design](http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/), containing Atoms, Molecules, Organisms, Templates and Pages for you to style & use 'out of the box' as well as aid you in defining your own components. Some skeleton documentation pages have been added too.

Keep what you need, delete what you don't and add whatever you like on top of whats already there.
